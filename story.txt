The story of Alexander Selkirk, the Scottish sailor who spent four years as a castaway. Selkirk was a sailor serving under Captain Thomas Stradling. In mid-expedition the captain made a stop for more supplies. Selkirk voiced his concern about the security of the ship with the extra weight carried on it. He tried and failed to rally others not to continue on. Stradling then decided to leave Selkirk alone on the island of Juan Fern√°ndez.
